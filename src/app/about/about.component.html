                WADU, in short, is an assistance platform. WADU helps people of all ages learn what type of jobs are available by the type
                of hobbies, skills, and skills yet to be learned the person has.
                <br> WADU does not focus on minumum wage, or obscene jobs.

                It is no surprise that their is a growing uncertainty amongst the people of today in terms of choosing a career. WADU solves
                that problem by giving the people options of what type of jobs are out there. The main focus is to help people
                do what they love. A friend of mine once said, "I really love movies and love screen writing and I couldn't
                imagine myself without both."
